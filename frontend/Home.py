# Hello there!

Wecome to my page. I'm Felix and I'm a Data Scientist thats curious and loves to build stuff.

## [fGPT](https://fgpt.felix-jobson.net) 

This is a language model trained that I trained from scratch on [tiny stories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759). Further details and the code are available on [github](https://github.com/felix-ha/fGPT).

## [ollama](https://ollama.felix-jobson.net)

Recently I played around with [ollama](https://ollama.ai/) and I host the [web ui](https://github.com/ollama-webui/ollama-webui) as well as the api on my server. 

Check out the [web ui here](https://ollama.felix-jobson.net)

The api is available at [ollama.api.felix-jobson.net](https://ollama.api.felix-jobson.net)

## [transformers-playground](https://transformers-playground.felix-jobson.net)
